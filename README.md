# VehicleMapper
A very simple FiveM script that allows you to easily map vehicle model names to much more friendly names using a JSON file

## Editing

Edit it, open `VehicleMapper.sln` in Visual Studio.

## Compilation

To build it, run `build.cmd`. The `dist` folder can be copied to your server resources.

## Installation

Grab the latest version from the releases page.

Afterwards, you can use `ensure VehicleMapper` in your server.cfg or server console to start the resource. You should make sure that this is after the `ensure chat` and such is ran.
